### Experience:

At Kubrick Group, I gained knowledge and real-world experience in professional skills, as well as a wide yet in depth array of modern technical and software engineering skills. We studied and applied the Agile, DevOps, SDLC practices within all our work, and gained detailed knowledge of Azure, GCP & AWS cloud providers.

I specialised in Cloud Engineering which involved learning and developing advanced skills in applying DevOps and SRE for Automation, CI/CD pipelines, Cloud native functions, Docker, and Kubernetes development and deployment. We focussed on the importance of Infrastructure as Code using Terraform for deployment into dev/test and production environments.

I have expertise in using Terraform for Infrastructure as Code in dev/test and production environments, and am experienced in implementing IAM and RBAC, creating multi-use cloud environments, configuring networking infrastructure, and working with both SQL and NoSQL databases.
